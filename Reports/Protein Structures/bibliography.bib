	abstract = {With the rapid development of next-generation sequencing technology, ever-increasing quantities of genomic data pose a tremendous challenge to data processing. Therefore, there is an urgent need for highly scalable and powerful computational systems. Among the state-of–the-art parallel computing platforms, Apache Spark is a fast, general-purpose, in-memory, iterative computing framework for large-scale data processing that ensures high fault tolerance and high scalability by introducing the resilient distributed dataset abstraction. In terms of performance, Spark can be up to 100 times faster in terms of memory access and 10 times faster in terms of disk access than Hadoop. Moreover, it provides advanced application programming interfaces in Java, Scala, Python, and R. It also supports some advanced components, including Spark SQL for structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for computing graphs, and Spark Streaming for stream computing. We surveyed Spark-based applications used in next-generation sequencing and other biological domains, such as epigenetics, phylogeny, and drug discovery. The results of this survey are used to provide a comprehensive guideline allowing bioinformatics researchers to apply Spark in their own fields.},

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Unfortunately, no computational method can produce accurate structures of protein complexes. AlphaFold2, has shown unprecedented levels of accuracy in modelling single chain protein structures. Here, we apply AlphaFold2 for the prediction of heterodimeric protein complexes. We find that the AlphaFold2 protocol together with optimised multiple sequence alignments, generate models with acceptable quality (DockQ ≥ 0.23) for 63\% of the dimers. From the predicted interfaces we create a simple function to predict the DockQ score which distinguishes acceptable from incorrect models as well as interacting from non-interacting proteins with state-of-art accuracy. We find that, using the predicted DockQ scores, we can identify 51\% of all interacting pairs at 1\% FPR., Predicting the structure of protein complexes is extremely difficult. Here, authors apply AlphaFold2 with optimized multiple sequence alignments to model complexes of interacting proteins, enabling prediction of both if and how proteins interact with state-of-art accuracy.},

	abstract = {We describe a general methodology for the design of large-scale recursive neural network architectures (DAG-RNNs) which comprises three fundamental steps: (1) representation of a given domain using suitable directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to connect visible and hidden node variables; (2) parameterization of the relationship between each variable and its parent variables by feedforward neural networks; and (3) application of weight-sharing within appropriate subsets of DAG connections to capture stationarity and control model complexity. Here we use these principles to derive several speciﬁc classes of DAG-RNN architectures based on lattices, trees, and other structured graphs. These architectures can process a wide range of data structures with variable sizes and dimensions. While the overall resulting models remain probabilistic, the internal deterministic dynamics allows efﬁcient propagation of information, as well as training by gradient descent, in order to tackle large-scale problems. These methods are used here to derive state-of-the-art predictors for protein structural features such as secondary structure (1D) and both ﬁne- and coarse-grained contact maps (2D). Extensions, relationships to graphical models, and implications for the design of neural architectures are brieﬂy discussed.

The membrane proteins, channel proteins, receptors, and degradative enzymes of the lysosome that were mentioned in the previous chapter all share properties that are common to all proteins. In addition to knowing their roles as cellular structures, the biotechnologist should be aware of proteins for their roles as bioactive substances. Some drugs are proteins, and most toxins are proteins. Proteins can be manufactured synthetically, or the biotechnologist might harness cells to manufacture specific proteins—even novel proteins designed by the scientist. In this chapter we will discuss protein structure, characteristics, and methods of isolation. More specifically, we will discuss: Amino acids, Amino acid charge, pKa, and isoelectric point, Primary protein structure, Secondary protein structure (such as the α-helix or -pleated sheet), Tertiary and quaternary protein structure, The hydrophobic effect. Then we will return to the cell and look more closely are membrane proteins with respect to: How proteins are embedded in the membrane, Movement within the membrane Isolation for study, Detergents, soaps, micelles Electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE.},

	abstract = {Immunoglobulins are heterodimeric proteins composed of two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains. They can be separated functionally into variable (V) domains that binds antigens and constant (C) domains that specify effector functions such as activation of complement or binding to Fc receptors. The variable domains are created by means of a complex series of gene rearrangement events, and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutation after exposure to antigen to allow affinity maturation. Each V domain can be split into three regions of sequence variability, termed the complementarity determining regions, or CDRs, and four regions of relatively constant sequence termed the framework regions, or FRs. The three CDRs of the H chain are paired with the three CDRs of the L chain to form the antigen binding site, as classically defined. There are five main classes of heavy chain C domains. Each class defines the IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, and IgE isotypes. IgG can be split into four subclasses, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, each with its own biologic properties; and IgA can similarly be split into IgA1 and IgA2. The constant domains of the H chain can be switched to allow altered effector function while maintaining antigen specificity.},
