	abstract = {Summary: The Protein Data Bank (PDB) has recently released versions of the PDB Exchange dictionary and the PDB archival data files in XML format collectively named PDBML. The automated generation of these XML files is driven by the data dictionary infrastructure in use at the PDB. The correspondences between the PDB dictionary and the XML schema metadata are described as well as the XML representations of PDB dictionaries and data files.Availability: The current software translated XML schema file is located at http://deposit.pdb.org/pdbML/pdbx-v1.000.xsd, and on the PDB mmCIF resource page at http://deposit.pdb.org/mmcif/. PDBML files are stored on the PDB beta ftp site at ftp://beta.rcsb.org/pub/pdb/uniformity/data/XMLContact:jwest@rcsb.rutgers.edu},
