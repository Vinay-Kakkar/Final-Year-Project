Therefore, there is an urgent need for highly scalable and powerful computational systems. Among the state-of–the-art parallel computing platforms, Apache Spark is a fast, general-purpose, in-memory, iterative computing framework for large-scale data processing that ensures high fault tolerance and high scalability by introducing the resilient distributed dataset abstraction. In terms of performance, Spark can be up to 100 times faster in terms of memory access and 10 times faster in terms of disk access than Hadoop. Moreover, it provides advanced application programming interfaces in Java, Scala, Python, and R. It also supports some advanced components, including Spark SQL for structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for computing graphs, and Spark Streaming for stream computing. We surveyed Spark-based applications used in next-generation sequencing and other biological domains, such as epigenetics, phylogeny, and drug discovery. The results of this survey are used to provide a comprehensive guideline allowing bioinformatics researchers to apply Spark in their own fields.},

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

We find that the AlphaFold2 protocol together with optimised multiple sequence alignments, generate models with acceptable quality (DockQ ≥ 0.23) for 63\% of the dimers. From the predicted interfaces we create a simple function to predict the DockQ score which distinguishes acceptable from incorrect models as well as interacting from non-interacting proteins with state-of-art accuracy. We find that, using the predicted DockQ scores, we can identify 51\% of all interacting pairs at 1\% FPR., Predicting the structure of protein complexes is extremely difficult.

	abstract = {We describe a general methodology for the design of large-scale recursive neural network architectures (DAG-RNNs) which comprises three fundamental steps: (1) representation of a given domain using suitable directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to connect visible and hidden node variables; (2) parameterization of the relationship between each variable and its parent variables by feedforward neural networks; and (3) application of weight-sharing within appropriate subsets of DAG connections to capture stationarity and control model complexity. Here we use these principles to derive several speciﬁc classes of DAG-RNN architectures based on lattices, trees, and other structured graphs. These architectures can process a wide range of data structures with variable sizes and dimensions. While the overall resulting models remain probabilistic, the internal deterministic dynamics allows efﬁcient propagation of information, as well as training by gradient descent, in order to tackle large-scale problems. These methods are used here to derive state-of-the-art predictors for protein structural features such as secondary structure (1D) and both ﬁne- and coarse-grained contact maps (2D). Extensions, relationships to graphical models, and implications for the design of neural architectures are brieﬂy discussed.

They can be separated functionally into variable (V) domains that binds antigens and constant (C) domains that specify effector functions such as activation of complement or binding to Fc receptors. The variable domains are created by means of a complex series of gene rearrangement events, and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutation after exposure to antigen to allow affinity maturation. Each V domain can be split into three regions of sequence variability, termed the complementarity determining regions, or CDRs, and four regions of relatively constant sequence termed the framework regions, or FRs. The three CDRs of the H chain are paired with the three CDRs of the L chain to form the antigen binding site, as classically defined. There are five main classes of heavy chain C domains. Each class defines the IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, and IgE isotypes. IgG can be split into four subclasses, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, each with its own biologic properties; and IgA can similarly be split into IgA1 and IgA2.

Covalent labeling (CL) with reagents that can irreversibly modify solvent accessible amino acid side chains is an effective way to encode structural information into the mass of a protein, as this information can be read-out in a straightforward manner using standard MS-based proteomics techniques. The differential reactivity of proteins under two or more conditions can be used to distinguish protein topologies, conformations, and/or binding sites. CL-MS methods have been effectively used for the structural analysis of proteins and protein complexes, particularly for systems that are difficult to study by other more traditional biochemical techniques. This review provides an overview of the non-specific CL approaches that have been combined with MS with a particular emphasis on the reagents that are commonly used, including hydroxyl radicals, carbenes, and diethylpyrocarbonate.

	abstract = {Proteins adopt different higher-order structures (HOS) to enable their unique biological functions. Understanding the complexities of protein higher-order structures and dynamics requires integrated approaches, where mass spectrometry (MS) is now positioned to play a key role. One of those approaches is protein footprinting. Although the initial demonstration of footprinting was for the HOS determination of protein/nucleic acid binding, the concept was later adapted to MS-based protein HOS analysis, through which different covalent labeling approaches “mark” the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of proteins to reflect protein HOS. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX), where deuterium in D2O replaces hydrogen of the backbone amides, is the most common example of footprinting. Its advantage is that the footprint reflects SASA and hydrogen bonding, whereas one drawback is the labeling is reversible. Another example of footprinting is slow irreversible labeling of functional groups on amino acid side chains by targeted reagents with high specificity, probing structural changes at selected sites. A third footprinting approach is by reactions with fast, irreversible labeling species that are highly reactive and footprint broadly several amino acid residue side chains on the time scale of submilliseconds. All of these covalent labeling approaches combine to constitute a problem-solving toolbox that enables mass spectrometry as a valuable tool for HOS elucidation. As there has been a growing need for MS-based protein footprinting in both academia and industry owing to its high throughput capability, prompt availability, and high spatial resolution, we present a summary of the history, descriptions, principles, mechanisms, and applications of these covalent labeling approaches. Moreover, their applications are highlighted according to the biological questions they can answer. This review is intended as a tutorial for MS-based protein HOS elucidation and as a reference for investigators seeking a MS-based tool to address structural questions in protein science.},

Therefore, methods to accurately elucidate three-dimensional structures of proteins are in high demand. While there are a few experimental techniques that can routinely provide high-resolution structures, such as x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cryo-EM, which have been developed to determine the structures of proteins, these techniques each have shortcomings and thus cannot be used in all cases. However, additionally, a large number of experimental techniques that provide some structural information, but not enough to assign atomic positions with high certainty have been developed. These methods offer sparse experimental data, which can also be noisy and inaccurate in some instances. In cases where it is not possible to determine the structure of a protein experimentally, computational structure prediction methods can be used as an alternative. Although computational methods can be performed without any experimental data in a large number of studies, inclusion of sparse experimental data into these prediction methods has yielded significant improvement. In this Perspective, we cover many of the successes of integrative modeling, computational modeling with experimental data, specifically for protein folding, protein–protein docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. We describe methods that incorporate sparse data from cryo-EM, NMR, mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance, small-angle x-ray scattering, Förster resonance energy transfer, and genetic sequence covariation.

Central to Rosetta’s success is the energy function: a model parametrized from small-molecule and X-ray crystal structure data used to approximate the energy associated with each biomolecule conformation. This paper describes the mathematical models and physical concepts that underlie the latest Rosetta energy function, called the Rosetta Energy Function 2015 (REF15). Applying these concepts, we explain how to use Rosetta energies to identify and analyze the features of biomolecular models. Finally, we discuss the latest advances in the energy function that extend its capabilities from soluble proteins to also include membrane proteins, peptides containing noncanonical amino acids, small molecules, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other macromolecules.},

Several methods based on docking to study protein complexes have also been well developed over the past few years. Most of these approaches are not driven by experimental data but are based on a combination of energetics and shape complementarity. Here, we present an approach called HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven protein−protein Docking) that makes use of biochemical and/or biophysical interaction data such as chemical shift perturbation data resulting from NMR titration experiments or mutagenesis data. This information is introduced as Ambiguous Interaction Restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking process. An AIR is defined as an ambiguous distance between all residues shown to be involved in the interaction. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated with three molecular complexes. For two of these complexes, for which both the complex and the free protein structures have been solved, NMR titration data were available. Mutagenesis data were used in the last example. In all cases, the best structures generated by HADDOCK, that is, the structures with the lowest intermolecular energies, were the closest to the published structure of the respective complexes (within 2.0 Å backbone RMSD).},

This task is usually facilitated by accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis (TvLDH) is described as an example. The download and installation of the MODELLER software is also described.},

Specifically, we first divided each Homo sapiens Refseq-derived gene's spliced nucleotide sequence into all of its possible contiguous 25 nt subsequences. For each of these 25 nt subsequences, we searched a recent human transcript mapping experiment's probe design for the 25 nt probe sequence having the fewest mismatches with the subsequence, but that did not match the subsequence exactly. Signal intensities measured with each gene's nearest-neighbor features were subsequently averaged to predict their gene expression levels in each of the experiment's thirty-three hybridizations. We examined the fidelity of this approach in terms of both sensitivity and specificity for detecting actively transcribed genes, for transcriptional consistency between exons of the same gene, and for reproducibility between tiling array designs. Taken together, our results provide proof-of-principle for probing nucleic acid targets with off-target, nearest-neighbor features.},

AlphaFold has appended projects and research directions. The database it has been creating promises an untold number of applications with vast potential impacts that are still difficult to surmise. AI approaches can revolutionize personalized treatments and usher in better-informed clinical trials. They promise to make giant leaps toward reshaping and revamping drug discovery strategies, selecting and prioritizing combinations of drug targets. Here, we briefly overview AI in structural biology, including in molecular dynamics simulations and prediction of microbiota–human protein–protein interactions. We highlight the advancements accomplished by the deep-learning-powered AlphaFold in protein structure prediction and their powerful impact on the life sciences. At the same time, AlphaFold does not resolve the decades-long protein folding challenge, nor does it identify the folding pathways. The models that AlphaFold provides do not capture conformational mechanisms like frustration and allostery, which are rooted in ensembles, and controlled by their dynamic distributions. Allostery and signaling are properties of populations. AlphaFold also does not generate ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins and regions, instead describing them by their low structural probabilities. Since AlphaFold generates single ranked structures, rather than conformational ensembles, it cannot elucidate the mechanisms of allosteric activating driver hotspot mutations nor of allosteric drug resistance. However, by capturing key features, deep learning techniques can use the single predicted conformation as the basis for generating a diverse ensemble.},

	abstract = {Protein structures can provide invaluable information, both for reasoning about biological processes and for enabling interventions such as structure-based drug development or targeted mutagenesis. After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure1. Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold2, at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

	abstract = {Hadoop in Action teaches readers how to use Hadoop and write MapReduce programs. The intended readers are programmers, architects, and project managers who have to process large amounts of data offline. Hadoop in Action will lead the reader from obtaining a copy of Hadoop to setting it up in a cluster and writing data analytic programs.The book begins by making the basic idea of Hadoop and MapReduce easier to grasp by applying the default Hadoop installation to a few easy-to-follow tasks, such as analyzing changes in word frequency across a body of documents. The book continues through the basic concepts of MapReduce applications developed using Hadoop, including a close look at framework components, use of Hadoop for a variety of data analysis tasks, and numerous examples of Hadoop in action.Hadoop in Action will explain how to use Hadoop and present design patterns and practices of programming MapReduce. MapReduce is a complex idea both conceptually and in its implementation, and Hadoop users are challenged to learn all the knobs and levers for running Hadoop. This book takes you beyond the mechanics of running Hadoop, teaching you to write meaningful programs in a MapReduce framework.This book assumes the reader will have a basic familiarity with Java, as most code examples will be written in Java. Familiarity with basic statistical concepts (e.g. histogram, correlation) will help the reader appreciate the more advanced data processing examples. Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book.},

	abstract = {Hadoop is a popular open-source implementation of MapReduce for the analysis of large datasets. To manage storage resources across the cluster, Hadoop uses a distributed user-level filesystem. This filesystem - HDFS - is written in Java and designed for portability across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms. This paper analyzes the performance of HDFS and uncovers several performance issues. First, architectural bottlenecks exist in the Hadoop implementation that result in inefficient HDFS usage due to delays in scheduling new MapReduce tasks. Second, portability limitations prevent the Java implementation from exploiting features of the native platform. Third, HDFS implicitly makes portability assumptions about how the native platform manages storage resources, even though native filesystems and I/O schedulers vary widely in design and behavior. This paper investigates the root causes of these performance bottlenecks in order to evaluate tradeoffs between portability and performance in the Hadoop distributed filesystem.},

So there is a need for a platform that can perform efficient data processing, which leads to the building up of platforms like Hadoop and Spark. Hadoop Map Reduce model helped to process it in a distributed fashion with computation being done at multiple nodes. In spite of the remarkable processing power it still, has some shortcomings. Spark, a computation engine can solve some of the problems involving Iterative/Machine learning queries by caching some of the results from previous queries. Although Spark is faster than Hadoop in most of the iterative applications it is constrained by memory requirements.

This huge internet resource involves a wide range of important biological data, obtained from experiments around the globe by different scientists. The Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) represents a brilliant collection of 3D structure data associated with important and vital biomolecules including nucleic acids (RNAs and DNAs) and proteins. Moreover, this database accumulates knowledge regarding function and evolution of biomacromolecules which supports different disciplines such as biotechnology. 3D structure, functional characteristics and phylogenetic properties of biomacromolecules give a deep understanding of the biomolecules’ characteristics. An important advantage of the wwPDB database is the data updating time, which is done every week. This updating process helps users to have the newest data and information for their projects. The data and information in wwPDB can be a great support to have an accurate imagination and illustrations of the biomacromolecules in biotechnology. As demonstrated by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, rapidly reliable and accessible biological data for microbiology, immunology, vaccinology, and drug development are critical to address many healthcare-related challenges that are facing humanity. The aim of this paper is to introduce the readers to wwPDB, and to highlight the importance of this database in biotechnology, with the expectation that the number of scientists interested in the utilization of Protein Data Bank’s resources will increase substantially in the coming years.},

Analyses of spatial locations, chemical properties, and structural and energetic impacts of the observed amino acid changes in {\textgreater}48,000 viral proteome sequences showed how each one of the 29 viral study proteins have undergone amino acid changes. Structural models computed for every unique sequence variant revealed that most substitutions map to protein surfaces and boundary layers with a minority affecting hydrophobic cores. Conservative changes were observed more frequently in cores versus boundary layers/surfaces. Active sites and protein-protein interfaces showed modest numbers of substitutions. Energetics calculations showed that the impact of substitutions on the thermodynamic stability of the proteome follows a universal bi-Gaussian distribution. Detailed results are presented for six drug discovery targets and four structural proteins comprising the virion, highlighting substitutions with the potential to impact protein structure, enzyme activity, and functional interfaces. Characterizing the evolution of the virus in three dimensions provides testable insights into viral protein function and should aid in structure-based drug discovery efforts as well as the prospective identification of amino acid substitutions with potential for drug resistance.},

Citation analyses revealed that these 5,914 PDB structures significantly affected the very large body of publicly funded research reported in publications on the NME targets that motivated biopharmaceutical company investment in discovery and development programs that produced the NMEs.},

	abstract = {The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is an international core data resource central to fundamental biology, biomedicine, bioenergy, and biotechnology/bioengineering. Now celebrating its 50th anniversary, the PDB houses {\textgreater}175,000 experimentally determined atomic structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes with one another and small molecules and drugs. The importance of three-dimensional (3D) biostructure information for research and education obtains from the intimate link between molecular form and function evident throughout biology. Among the most prolific consumers of PDB data are biomedical researchers, who rely on the open access resource as the authoritative source of well-validated, expertly curated biostructures. This review recounts how the PDB grew from just seven protein structures to contain more than 49,000 structures of human proteins that have proven critical for understanding their roles in human health and disease. It then describes how these structures are used in academe and industry to validate drug targets, assess target druggability, characterize how tool compounds and other small-molecules bind to drug targets, guide medicinal chemistry optimization of binding affinity and selectivity, and overcome challenges during preclinical drug development. Three case studies drawn from oncology exemplify how structural biologists and open access to PDB structures impacted recent regulatory approvals of antineoplastic drugs.},

The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.},

	abstract = {Biochemical and biological functions of proteins are the product of both the overall fold of the polypeptide chain, and, typically, structural motifs made up of smaller numbers of amino acids constituting a catalytic center or a binding site that may be remote from one another in amino acid sequence. Detection of such structural motifs can provide valuable insights into the function(s) of previously uncharacterized proteins. Technically, this remains an extremely challenging problem because of the size of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive. Existing methods depend on a clustering by sequence similarity and can be computationally slow. We have developed a new approach that uses an inverted index strategy capable of analyzing {\textgreater}170,000 PDB structures with unmatched speed. The efficiency of the inverted index method depends critically on identifying the small number of structures containing the query motif and ignoring most of the structures that are irrelevant. Our approach (implemented at motif.rcsb.org) enables real-time retrieval and superposition of structural motifs, either extracted from a reference structure or uploaded by the user. Herein, we describe the method and present five case studies that exemplify its efficacy and speed for analyzing 3D structures of both proteins and nucleic acids.},

In addition, emerging integrative or hybrid methods (I/HM) are producing structural models of huge macromolecular machines and assemblies, sometimes containing 100s of millions of non-hydrogen atoms. The performance requirements for visualization and analysis tools delivering these data are increasing rapidly. Significant progress in developing online, web-native three-dimensional (3D) visualization tools was previously accomplished with the introduction of the LiteMol suite and NGL Viewers. Thereafter, Mol* development was jointly initiated by PDBe and RCSB PDB to combine and build on the strengths of LiteMol (developed by PDBe) and NGL (developed by RCSB PDB). The web-native Mol* Viewer enables 3D visualization and streaming of macromolecular coordinate and experimental data, together with capabilities for displaying structure quality, functional, or biological context annotations. High-performance graphics and data management allows users to simultaneously visualise up to hundreds of (superimposed) protein structures, stream molecular dynamics simulation trajectories, render cell-level models, or display huge I/HM structures. It is the primary 3D structure viewer used by PDBe and RCSB PDB. It can be easily integrated into third-party services. Mol* Viewer is open source and freely available at https://molstar.org/.},

	abstract = {The size of the databases used in today's enterprises has been growing at exponential rates day by day. Simultaneously, the need to process and analyze the large volumes of data for business decision making has also increased. In several business and scientific applications, there is a need to process terabytes of data in efficient manner on daily bases. This has contributed to the big data problem faced by the industry due to the inability of conventional database systems and software tools to manage or process the big data sets within tolerable time limits. Processing of data can include various operations depending on usage like culling, tagging, highlighting, indexing, searching, faceting, etc operations. It is not possible for single or few machines to store or process this huge amount of data in a finite time period. This paper reports the experimental work on big data problem and its optimal solution using Hadoop cluster, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storage and using parallel processing to process large data sets using Map Reduce programming framework. We have done prototype implementation of Hadoop cluster, HDFS storage and Map Reduce framework for processing large data sets by considering prototype of big data application scenarios. The results obtained from various experiments indicate favorable results of above approach to address big data problem.},
