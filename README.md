# Final Year Project #

# Project Directory #

The PROJECT directory contains all of the work completed for this project. Below is a summary of the folders and files contained within the directory.

# Notes #

The Notes folder contains all of the information collected on the required background reading. These notes helped to create the literature review.

# Programs #

The Programs folder contains three subfolders:

* Lines
* TMalign
* TempFileTest

# Lines #

The Lines program returns the number of lines in a file.

# TmAlign #

The TmAlign program analyzes protein structures using MapReduce.

# TempFileTest #

A test program used to experiment with temporary files in the Lines program.

# ProofofConcepts #

The ProofofConcepts folder contains two subfolders:

* PDBontaCluster
* TmAlign

# PDBontaCluster #

PDBontaCluster is a program that distributes protein structure files amongst MapReduce clusters.

# TmAlign #

TmAlign proves we can MapReduce using a single type of executable for analyzing protein structures.

# Python_Tutorial #

The Python_Tutorial folder contains all the tutorials completed to understand the basics of features. This includes using APIs, setting up clusters, performing MapReduce functions, and Test Projects used to help understand the basics of PySpark.

The folder contains four subfolders:

* ApiTests
* Cluster_Tutorial
* MapReduce_Tutorial
* TestProject

# Reports #

The Reports folder contains all reports created for this project. These include:

* Interim Report
* Project Report
* Report on Protein Data Bank
* Report on Protein Structures
* Template
* Latex

# main #

The main folder contains:

* Available functions in separate Python files
* A main Python file that contains all the available functions in one file
* Unit tests created to be run on the main Python file
* Two benchmarking Python programs: one for Lines and one for TMalign.
