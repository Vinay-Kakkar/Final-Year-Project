# Final Year Project

This repository has been created to store your final year project.

You may edit it as you like, but please do not remove the default topics or the project members list. These need to stay as currently defined in order for your supervisor to be able to find your project.

The TestProject folder is a tutorial taken from this blog in which it shows how to setup python with a spark api https://medium.com/swlh/apache-spark-is-fun-eadcaf141c02
